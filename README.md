# dotfiles

These are my configuration files. You can install them by running `rake install`. You'll need to run `git submodule init` followed by `git submodule update` to pull in all of the Vim plugins. Finally, to get the [Command-T][cmt] plugin working, `cd` into its directory (`.vim/bundle/command-t`) and run `rake make`.
